### 1. **Describe a moment when you felt entirely yourself.**

Write about a single moment—large or small—when you experienced a deep sense of authenticity, as if all the parts of you were aligned. Be as vivid and specific as possible, drawing out the environment, the people (if any), your thoughts, and what made the moment feel true. Avoid vague ideas about identity; instead, explore how you *knew* it was real. What shifted? What stayed with you? What did it teach you about what it means to live in alignment?

---

### 2. **Tell the story of a belief or value that has remained constant throughout your life.**

Choose a principle, belief, or value that you feel has never wavered—something that has served as a compass in your actions or decisions. Rather than simply stating it, trace its origin, explore how it has been challenged, and describe the ways it has shaped your behavior or understanding of the world. This essay should show continuity through change, and how a single core value can act as a foundation for personal growth.

---

### 3. **Write about a cultural tradition, story, or ancestral teaching that continues to shape you.**

Focus on a cultural teaching, story, or tradition that holds meaning in your life—not just as a ritual, but as a guide. Describe its origin and transmission, and then explore its impact on your thinking, values, or habits. This essay should connect individual and collective history, exploring how tradition can evolve while retaining its essence. You are encouraged to reflect on both the emotional and intellectual weight of inheritance.

---

### 4. **Reflect on what it means to belong.**

Explore the idea of belonging not as a simple matter of group membership but as a layered emotional and social experience. You might consider how belonging shows up physically, emotionally, culturally, or philosophically. The strongest essays will reflect on moments of connection and disconnection, the tensions between fitting in and being seen, and how your ideas of belonging have changed. This is as much about internal belonging as it is about external inclusion.

---

### 5. **Describe something sacred to you that is not conventionally recognized as sacred.**

Choose an object, space, act, or moment that you regard as sacred—even if most people wouldn’t see it that way. Your goal is to write in a way that conveys its depth and meaning without relying on traditional religious or cultural definitions. This essay should draw the reader into your sense of reverence and show how the sacred can exist in the mundane. Subtlety, detail, and sincerity are key.

---

### 6. **Write about a question you’ve carried with you for years.**

Some questions linger not because they are unanswered but because they are alive. Write about a question that continues to shape your thinking, your choices, or your worldview. Rather than seeking closure, examine how the question has changed over time, how it has deepened or widened, and what its persistence reveals. A strong essay will not treat the question as a problem to solve but as a path to walk.

---

### 7. **Tell the story of a time when you were caught between being true to yourself and honoring a group or tradition you care about.**

Describe a moment of internal conflict where loyalty to yourself and loyalty to something greater were at odds. Show both sides with empathy and nuance. This is not just a story of choosing, but of grappling. The best essays will not rely on drama but will reveal complexity—why both paths mattered, what was at stake, and what kind of growth or insight emerged from the tension.

---

### 8. **Describe a memory that returns to you again and again.**

Choose a memory that repeats—not necessarily because it is traumatic or joyful, but because it’s *sticky*. Explore its textures, sounds, emotions, and unanswered questions. Why does it come back? What role does it play in your present life? This essay should reveal the way memory isn’t passive—it acts on us, reshaping how we think, feel, and interpret new experiences.

---

### 9. **Imagine your life as a myth or parable passed on by future generations.**

Write your life, or a portion of it, as a timeless story told by others long after you're gone. This isn’t biography—it’s mythology. Use symbolic language, archetypal roles, or allegory to convey something essential. A strong essay will strike a balance between imagination and clarity, inviting the reader to see not just what happened, but what it means in a broader human story.

---

### 10. **Write a letter to the future on behalf of your generation.**

Address an imagined reader in the distant future—someone trying to understand who your generation was, what it valued, and what it left behind. This isn’t just about praise or blame—it’s about clarity, honesty, and legacy. Explore the emotional, cultural, environmental, and technological elements of your time. The letter should reflect both the fear and the hope of those living through this era, with a clear sense of voice and responsibility.

---

### 11. **Design a society with one missing sense—sight, sound, smell, taste, or touch.**

Pick one of the five senses and imagine an entire society where no one is born with it. Don't focus only on what’s missing—explore what evolves instead. How would people communicate? What kinds of technology or customs would replace what the sense once offered? How would emotions, relationships, learning, and art change? This essay should show systemic imagination, revealing how a small shift rewires everything.

---

### 12. **Explain how two completely different things could be considered the same.**

Choose two things—ideas, objects, forces—that seem totally unrelated or even opposite. Then make a case for how they are fundamentally alike. This is not about proving a fact but about demonstrating how thinking itself works: how analogy, structure, and metaphor let us bridge gaps. A good essay will blend imagination with logic, and show how surprising connections can offer deep insight.

---

### 13. **Rebuild civilization with only the knowledge a child can understand.**

Assume the world has collapsed. You must plant the seeds of a new one, but your only tools are ideas a child could understand. What stories, lessons, habits, or values would you pass down? How would you teach things like justice, community, or time? A strong essay will show an understanding of human needs at both the simplest and most profound levels, while reflecting on how complexity grows from simplicity.

---

### 14. **Invent a universal rule that everyone must follow—but it must seem unnecessary at first.**

Create a law or practice that all people must follow, but which might seem odd or pointless at first glance. Then build the case—slowly, with examples and implications—for how this rule transforms people, systems, or relationships in meaningful ways. The best essays will show how small changes in behavior can ripple outward, and will reward slow thinking, subtle insight, and creative reasoning.

---

### 15. **Tell a story that loops back to its own beginning without repeating.**

Write a story—real or imagined—where the end leads back to the beginning, but everything has changed. The challenge is to explore circularity without redundancy. How does something return transformed? What makes a loop meaningful instead of stagnant? The strongest essays will blend narrative and philosophy, using structure to reflect insight.
