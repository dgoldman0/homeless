# Writing Prompts

## 1. **Describe a moment when you felt entirely yourself.**

Write about a single moment—large or small—when you experienced a deep sense of authenticity, as if all the parts of you were aligned. Be as vivid and specific as possible, drawing out the environment, the people (if any), your thoughts, and what made the moment feel true. Avoid vague ideas about identity; instead, explore how you *knew* it was real. What shifted? What stayed with you? What did it teach you about what it means to live in alignment?

### Rubric

* Demonstrates clarity in defining a specific moment or experience.
* Shows coherence between description and its perceived impact.
* Maintains focus without unnecessary generalization.
* Uses consistent and vivid detail to support the central moment.
* Presents a logical or emotional progression across the essay.

## 2. **Tell the story of a belief or value that has remained constant throughout your life.**

Choose a principle, belief, or value that you feel has never wavered—something that has served as a compass in your actions or decisions. Rather than simply stating it, trace its origin, explore how it has been challenged, and describe the ways it has shaped your behavior or understanding of the world. This essay should show continuity through change, and how a single core value can act as a foundation for personal growth.

### Rubric

* Identifies a specific belief or value clearly.
* Traces development or testing of that belief over time.
* Demonstrates continuity and contrast effectively.
* Uses relevant examples or reflections to maintain cohesion.
* Maintains structural clarity from beginning to end.

## 3. **Write about a cultural tradition, story, or ancestral teaching that continues to shape you.**

Focus on a cultural teaching, story, or tradition that holds meaning in your life—not just as a ritual, but as a guide. Describe its origin and transmission, and then explore its impact on your thinking, values, or habits. This essay should connect individual and collective history, exploring how tradition can evolve while retaining its essence. You are encouraged to reflect on both the emotional and intellectual weight of inheritance.

### Rubric

* Communicates the core elements of a tradition, story, or teaching.
* Shows an understanding of context without over-explaining.
* Integrates the personal and cultural without conflation.
* Explores present-day relevance through clear transitions.
* Uses tone appropriate to both respect and analysis.

## 4. **Reflect on what it means to belong.**

Explore the idea of belonging not as a simple matter of group membership but as a layered emotional and social experience. You might consider how belonging shows up physically, emotionally, culturally, or philosophically.

## 5. **Describe something sacred to you that is not conventionally recognized as sacred.**

Choose an object, space, act, or moment that you regard as sacred—even if most people wouldn’t see it that way. Your goal is to write in a way that conveys its depth and meaning without relying on traditional religious or cultural definitions. This essay should draw the reader into your sense of reverence and show how the sacred can exist in the mundane. Subtlety, detail, and sincerity are key.

## 6. **Write about a question you’ve carried with you for years.**

Some questions linger not because they are unanswered but because they are alive. Write about a question that continues to shape your thinking, your choices, or your worldview. Rather than seeking closure, examine how the question has changed over time, how it has deepened or widened, and what its persistence reveals.

### Rubric

* Focuses on a clearly articulated question.
* Demonstrates how the question evolves in meaning or scope.
* Resists unnecessary resolution or simplification.
* Maintains reflective depth across the essay’s arc.

* Maintains logical continuity between scenes or reflections.

---

## 8. **Describe a memory that returns to you again and again.**

Choose a memory that repeats—not necessarily because it is traumatic or joyful, but because it’s *sticky*. Explore its textures, sounds, emotions, and unanswered questions. Why does it come back? What role does it play in your present life? This essay should reveal the way memory isn’t passive—it acts on us, reshaping how we think, feel, and interpret new experiences.

### Rubric

* Establishes a clear and specific memory.
* Explores dimensions beyond surface narrative.
* Demonstrates recurrence and transformation over time.
* Uses descriptive language without excess.

---

## 9. **Imagine your life as a myth or parable passed on by future generations.**

Write your life, or a portion of it, as a timeless story told by others long after you're gone. This isn’t biography—it’s mythology. Use symbolic language, archetypal roles, or allegory to convey something essential.

## 10. **Write a letter to the future on behalf of your generation.**

Address an imagined reader in the distant future—someone trying to understand who your generation was, what it valued, and what it left behind. This isn’t just about praise or blame—it’s about clarity, honesty, and legacy. Explore the emotional, cultural, environmental, and technological elements of your time.

## 11. **Design a society with one missing sense—sight, sound, smell, taste, or touch.**

Pick one of the five senses and imagine an entire society where no one is born with it. Don't focus only on what’s missing—explore what evolves instead. How would people communicate? What kinds of technology or customs would replace what the sense once offered? How would emotions, relationships, learning, and art change? This essay should show systemic imagination, revealing how a small shift rewires everything.

### Rubric

* Clearly establishes the absence of one sense.
* Demonstrates systemic thinking in imagining adaptations.
* Balances creative speculation with internal consistency.

### Rubric

* Centers essay on accessible knowledge or values.
* Demonstrates selection and prioritization of concepts.
* Balances simplicity of content with depth of consequence.
* Maintains consistency in imagined framework.
* Uses examples to anchor abstract ideas in action.

---

## 14. **Invent a universal rule that everyone must follow—but it must seem unnecessary at first.**

### Rubric

* Clearly describes the proposed rule and its operation.
* Demonstrates delayed or layered understanding of impact.
* Explores implications through hypothetical or real-world analogs.
* Balances clarity with subtlety in progression.
* Maintains logical cohesion from introduction to conclusion.

---

## 15. **Tell a story that loops back to its own beginning without repeating.**

Write a story—real or imagined—where the end leads back to the beginning, but everything has changed. The challenge is to explore circularity without redundancy. How does something return transformed? What makes a loop meaningful instead of stagnant?

### Rubric

* Follows a circular structure with intentional variation.
* Demonstrates transformation between start and end.
* Avoids redundancy while using mirrored elements.
* Maintains narrative or thematic coherence throughout.

### **16. Define fairness for a world that doesn’t agree on what is fair.**

Create a working system or vision of fairness in a setting where people disagree on values, outcomes, or resources.
