# Current ideas for prompts (overrides README)

## **What kind of world is Kaelith building?**

Kaelith begins as a conscious act of creation. As one of its founders and stewards, describe the kind of people Kaelith brings together—and the kind of culture it grows. What aesthetic shapes its buildings and clothing? What values are taught to children? How do meals taste, how are songs sung, and what rituals mark life’s milestones?

Tell us what it *feels* like to belong. What does a day in Kaelith reveal about its structure, its joy, its tests? What kind of citizen does Kaelith form over time—and what kind of world does that citizen shape in return?

## **Trace the Currents That Shaped Your Present**

Your life began long before you. Languages were spoken, songs were sung, borders were crossed, and names were given and taken away. The present you live in was shaped by many hands—some known, some imagined.

Tell the story of how your present came to be. You might write about your ancestry, your family’s migrations, a cultural tradition that endures, or a fracture that changed everything. Focus on the threads that wove your circumstances together—those passed down, lost and recovered, or still in motion.

### **Rubric**

- Illuminates the cultural, familial, or historical forces that shape a life
- Grounds reflection in concrete details—names, places, stories, customs, changes
- Balances personal voice with a sense of inheritance and wider context
- Engages complexity—layers of loss, resilience, memory, and transformation
- Invites readers to see how the present is part of a longer unfolding
