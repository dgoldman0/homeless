# Chain-of-Thought Fine-Tuning Training Path

This outlines a training path for fine-tuning a language model to reason through real-world issues using structured chains of thought, guided by subquestions. The system emphasizes domain separation, dynamic prompt generation, and logical progression.

## Stage 1: Chain-of-Thought Reasoning Base

**Purpose:**
Teach the model to reason from a real-world issue through a structured pathway to an actionable output using a curated map of subquestions. This model can be saved as a base model and used over and over again with new training data sets based on submissions to the essay prompts. 

**Reasoning Path:**

1. **Real-world issue**
2. **Identify relevant prompts/subquestions**

   * Why do these connect?
3. **Map out logical steps and implications**
4. **Summarize current understanding**
5. **Evaluate whether a real-world output can be proposed**
6. **Output actionable result or next step**
7. **Repeat if needed**

**Training Data Format:**

* **Input**: One real-world scenario
* **Steps**: Intermediate reasoning using question chain
* **Output**: Final insight, summary, or decision

**Example (abstracted):**

* Input: "Rebuilding a civilization with only child-level knowledge"
* Subquestion Links:

  * What is fundamental knowledge?
  * How do societies organize around simplicity?
* Chain of Thought:

  * Language, shelter, food, basic tools.
  * Social roles and stories are preserved via play and imitation.
* Output: "Most civilizations would prioritize hands-on survival knowledge and oral transmission of custom."

## Stage 2: Dynamic Training Pair Generation

**Purpose:**
Prevent overfitting and allow broader generalization by generating new prompt–completion pairs from essays or collections of subanswers.

**Method:**

* Use domain tagging for each essay
* Extract:

  * Subquestion connections
  * Divergent perspectives
  * Shared logic paths
* Construct new synthetic prompt–answer pairs that reflect varied reasoning

**Use Cases:**

* Answer population-wide versions of subquestions
* Summarize differences in reasoning across submissions
* Generate variants to enrich underrepresented domains

## Stage 3: Prompt–Completion Matching

**Purpose:**
Train the model to generate high-quality answers to subquestions, grounded in general patterns observed across submissions.

**Method:**

* Feed the model fixed question prompts
* Generate or curate answers reflecting:

  * Common conclusions
  * Diverse paths to similar insights
  * Answers grounded in the chain-of-thought method

**Example Prompt–Completion Pair:**

* Prompt: "What knowledge is fundamental across all societies?"
* Completion: "Fundamental knowledge includes communication, methods of obtaining food, and principles of cooperation."

## Domain Isolation and Prompt Adaptation

**Goal:**
Avoid the model getting saturated on one domain or internalizing redundant narrow pathways.

**Approach:**

* Tag all data with domain categories
* Use balanced sampling during training
* Adapt prompt wording to clarify domain without narrowing too far

  * E.g., “What knowledge is essential?” → “What knowledge is essential *in post-collapse societies*?”

## Overall Lifecycle

1. **Chain-of-thought base model** trained to navigate real-world → subquestion → output chains
2. **Dynamic data generation system** enriches training across domains
3. **Subquestion answerer** fine-tunes prompt–completion reasoning
4. **Domain-aware filtering and balancing** ensures breadth, prevents saturation
