# **National Contribution Credit System**

## **Overview**

The National Contribution Credit System is a framework for recognizing and rewarding individuals who contribute meaningfully to the health, advancement, and cohesion of their society—regardless of whether that society is governed by a traditional state, a cooperative federation, or a decentralized network.

Contributions are evaluated across a broad range of domains, scored using a standardized rubric, and recorded in a public or semi-public **Merit Ledger**. Rather than relying solely on hierarchy or inheritance, this system affirms merit through action, integrity, and sustained service. Credit is conferred only after structured review and approval via a **DAO-based governance mechanism**, ensuring both fairness and transparency.

### The Rank System

The rank system exists to recognize those who contribute meaningfully, consistently, and across the full spectrum of national life. It is based on two measures:

1. **Total Credits Earned** – a cumulative measure of all contributions across nine major domains.
2. **Geometric Mean Across Domains** – the 9th-root of the individual category scores, ensuring some degree of balance and engagement across all fields.

Unlike linear point systems that reward specialization at the expense of broader involvement, the geometric mean model ensures that no one can ascend while ignoring entire areas of contribution. This doesn’t mean everyone must perform equally in every category—far from it—but each person must show at least a baseline level of engagement in all domains to progress.

Credits are earned using a scoring rubric that accounts for effort, impact, rarity, and reproducibility. Small actions earn 1–5 credits, while significant projects can earn 150–250. Productivity rates vary depending on activity type, but contributors generally earn **around 9 credits per hour** across a mix of tasks. With this credit flow in mind, the ranks are structured to scale naturally with a contributor's investment and well-roundedness.

### Rank Thresholds

| **Tier** | **Title**   | **Total Credits Required** | **Required Geometric Mean** | **Typical Meaning**                                    |
| -------- | ----------- | -------------------------- | --------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------ |
| I        | Contributor | 250                        | 10                          | Initial recognition for ongoing engagement             |
| II       | Builder     | 1,000                      | 20                          | Actively helping across at least several domains       |
| III      | Esteemed    | 3,000                      | 35                          | Recognized and consistent contributor to national life |
| IV       | Luminary    | 10,000                     | 55                          | Leader of initiatives and sustained cross-field work   |
| V        | Pillar      | 25,000                     | 75                          | A widely relied-on figure with deep and broad impact   |
| VI       | Sage        | 60,000                     | 100                         | A long-term source of guidance, history, and insight   |

The geometric mean requirement rises significantly at each tier. Even as people specialize, they must continually contribute to all nine domains. A single domain score near zero will sharply reduce the geometric mean and block advancement. This guards against over-specialization while giving full freedom of focus—as long as there’s some engagement with the whole.

### Estimated Time to Reach Each Tier

The following table shows realistic timelines based on how many hours per week a person dedicates to credited work, assuming an average **productivity of 9 credits per hour** and balanced contribution across domains.

| **Hours per Week** | **Credits per Week** | **Tier I**   | **Tier II**  | **Tier III** | **Tier IV** | **Tier V**   | **Tier VI**  |
| ------------------ | -------------------- | ------------ | ------------ | ------------ | ----------- | ------------ | ------------ |
| 5 h / week         | \~45                 | \~1.3 months | \~5.6 months | \~1.3 years  | \~4.3 years | \~10.7 years | \~25.6 years |
| 10 h / week        | \~90                 | \~0.6 months | \~2.6 months | \~0.6 years  | \~2.1 years | \~5.3 years  | \~12.8 years |
| 20 h / week        | \~180                | \~0.3 months | \~1.3 months | \~4.3 months | \~1.1 years | \~2.7 years  | \~6.4 years  |
| 40 h / week        | \~320                | \~0.2 months | \~0.7 months | \~2.2 months | \~0.6 years | \~1.5 years  | \~3.6 years  |

These numbers reflect the steady pace of someone who keeps all domains active. Inactive categories will lower the geometric mean and delay progress, regardless of credit volume.

This system balances recognition for effort and excellence with a healthy demand for broad civic awareness. Contributors advance not by conforming to one ideal, but by demonstrating sustained engagement and meaningful impact over time.

---

## **General Workflow for Credit Attribution**

This section outlines the process by which contributions are proposed, verified, categorized, scored, and ultimately recognized through the Merit Ledger via DAO governance.

---

### **Step 1: Open a Credit Docket**

The contributor (or nominator) initiates a new **Credit Docket** via the **Merit Ledger Portal**.

* Indicate whether the proposal is self-submitted or for someone else.
* Provide core information: contributor identity, dates, general context, and initial description.
* Begin structured intake with guided prompts.

---

### **Step 2: Information Collection**

The portal collects detailed information about the contribution:

* What was done, when, and where
* Individual vs. collaborative effort
* Intended and actual impact
* Supporting materials, media, or documentation
* Whether this is part of a series of related contributions

At this stage, the goal is to **understand and structure** the contribution, not to verify it.

---

### **Step 3: Contribution Structuring**

The system analyzes the input to determine:

* Whether this is a single contribution or a multi-effort bundle
* The general nature of the action (e.g., direct service, technical creation, leadership, etc.)
* Relationship to previous credits (if any)

This forms the internal structure used for validation and scoring.

---

### **Step 4: Contextual Verification**

Once structured, the system begins validation:

* Searches public records, project archives, and known registries
* Requests or ingests third-party confirmations
* Accepts documentation from the contributor
* Flags unverifiable contributions for peer review or human council consideration

All verification steps are logged.

---

### **Step 5: Category and Subdomain Assignment**

Using structured input and verified context, the system identifies the most fitting category or categories and assigns one or more subdomains.

In ambiguous cases, contributors may be shown several options and asked to justify their choice.

---

### **Step 6: Rubric-Based Scoring**

Each contribution is scored based on five core criteria:

* **Impact** – measurable effect or scope
* **Initiative** – level of autonomy, creativity, or risk
* **Consistency** – single act vs. sustained work
* **Recognition** – endorsements, testimonials, or cultural visibility
* **Difficulty** – complexity, sacrifice, or resource demands

Modifiers include:

* **Self-Care adjustment**, positively or negatively weighted
* **Cross-category synergy bonus**, if applicable

---

### **Step 7: DAO Proposal for Credit Assignment**

Rather than updating the ledger directly:

* A **DAO proposal** is issued automatically
* Includes all structured data, rubric scores, and verification logs
* DAO members review, approve, modify, or reject proposals
* The LLM based system also will have a vote based on an assigned voting power, and will vote based after the public voting and comments are closed and will take into account the information in the proposal discussion board as well. 
* On approval, the proposal triggers a smart contract call to **update the contributor’s Merit Ledger profile**

## **Scoring Rubric**

The scoring rebric creates a fair grading system that will be used to inform voters and also the LLM based auto processor. The full rubric has its own [markdown file](https://github.com/dgoldman0/homeless/blob/main/nation_credit/rubric.md).
