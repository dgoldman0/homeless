# üßÆ National Contribution Credit Scoring Rubric

This document defines the official scoring rubric for assigning **credit values** to individual contributions. Credits are awarded using a **multiplicative model**, based on a fixed **base value** and four **scoring modifiers**:

$$
\text{Credits} = 1 \times M_{\text{Effort}} \times M_{\text{Impact}} \times M_{\text{Rarity}} \times M_{\text{Reproducibility}}
$$

Each modifier is assigned a value from **0.5 to 5.0**, reflecting the nature of the contribution. The following sections provide comprehensive definitions and examples for each level of each modifier to ensure clarity and fairness in evaluation.

---

## üîß **Modifier 1: Effort**

### **What This Measures**

**Effort** reflects the **intensity, duration, and personal cost** of a contribution. It accounts for the amount of time spent, the type of labor involved (physical, mental, emotional), and the personal discipline or endurance required. Importantly, this modifier is not simply about how ‚Äúlong‚Äù something takes‚Äîit‚Äôs about **focused, meaningful labor** in service of a contribution‚Äôs completion. Tasks that demand deep concentration, long hours, emotional energy, or resilience in challenging conditions will earn higher scores. Conversely, habitual, low-energy, or incidental actions receive lower scores.

This measure should *not* be inflated for tasks that were made difficult through inefficiency, procrastination, or poor preparation. The goal is to reward effective, invested work‚Äînot suffering for its own sake.

---

### üî¢ **Effort Score: 0.5**

**Definition:**
The action required **little to no effort**. It may have been incidental, passive, or done in passing. The contributor likely exerted minimal energy or attention and performed the task without disrupting their flow or needing preparation.

**Examples:**

* Mentioning a resource or link during a conversation that turned out helpful.
* Making a brief comment in a forum or meeting that nudged a decision.
* Tightening a bolt that was visibly loose while walking past a machine.

---

### üî¢ **Effort Score: 1.0**

**Definition:**
A **standard contribution** that falls within the expected duties of the person‚Äôs skills or role. It required some focus and care but was familiar, routine, or reasonably easy to complete. These are contributions that, while useful, **did not stretch the contributor** beyond what they typically offer.

**Examples:**

* Teaching a regularly scheduled class for which the material was already prepared.
* Running a diagnostic test on a known system using a checklist.
* Organizing a routine food distribution using an established template.

---

### üî¢ **Effort Score: 2.0**

**Definition:**
The task required **moderate effort**. It demanded continuous focus for an extended period (e.g., an hour or more), or involved juggling multiple components, troubleshooting, or adapting under pressure. The contributor likely had to push themselves to stay productive and attentive.

**Examples:**

* Moderating a heated 2-hour community discussion while keeping people on topic.
* Creating a presentation that required researching new material and designing clear visuals.
* Restoring a piece of equipment that had no immediate documentation, requiring trial and error.

---

### üî¢ **Effort Score: 3.0**

**Definition:**
This contribution required **sustained and substantial effort**, either over many hours in one sitting or spread across multiple sessions. The contributor had to prepare extensively, work through complexity, or endure personal strain. Physical labor, advanced problem-solving, or emotional exhaustion often factor into this level.

**Examples:**

* Leading a multi-day training for new apprentices, including custom materials.
* Coordinating logistics for a full-day festival involving dozens of volunteers.
* Digging and installing a new irrigation line by hand over several days.

---

### üî¢ **Effort Score: 5.0**

**Definition:**
The task was **exceptionally demanding**, pushing the contributor near or beyond their normal limits. It required **maximum personal investment**‚Äîwhether in terms of time, complexity, emotional vulnerability, or physical endurance. Typically, this effort would involve multiple long sessions, critical stakes, or highly challenging environments.

**Examples:**

* Writing a 100-page technical manual over several weeks, based on new designs.
* Performing medical or caregiving work through an overnight emergency.
* Single-handedly evacuating and relocating valuable equipment during a sudden flood.

---

## üåç **Modifier 2: Impact**

### **What This Measures**

**Impact** measures the **reach, significance, and consequence** of a contribution. It reflects how widely a contribution benefits others, how much it changes or improves a system, and how long-lasting its effects are. Impact can be direct (e.g., fixing a key system used daily) or indirect (e.g., improving morale, enabling others' success). A task with a small footprint but long-term consequence may score higher than a high-visibility act with only short-term relevance.

Impact must be **tied to demonstrable outcomes**‚Äînot speculation or intention. A well-intentioned project with little follow-through should not score high simply because it aimed high.

---

### üî¢ **Impact Score: 0.5**

**Definition:**
The contribution had **negligible or redundant effect**. It may have repeated existing work, applied to a very narrow context, or made no meaningful difference in practical terms.

**Examples:**

* Fixing a device that was already marked for replacement.
* Posting a suggestion that was ignored or unused.
* Correcting a small error in a lightly used document.

---

### üî¢ **Impact Score: 1.0**

**Definition:**
The action provided **localized or individual benefit**, supporting a small team or task. It added real value, but the effects were confined to a narrow scope or short time period.

**Examples:**

* Helping a single person resolve a bug in their work.
* Updating outdated signage in one part of a shared space.
* Revising a meal plan for one event or location.

---

### üî¢ **Impact Score: 2.0**

**Definition:**
The contribution supported a **whole group, space, or process**. It created noticeable improvements in flow, comfort, clarity, or resource access across multiple people or recurring activities.

**Examples:**

* Creating a streamlined scheduling template used across multiple teams.
* Improving walkability or safety on a shared path through resurfacing.
* Translating a key document for general use.

---

### üî¢ **Impact Score: 3.0**

**Definition:**
The contribution had **broad reach** or strategically enabled success at a larger scale. It changed how people operate or think, reduced structural inefficiencies, or led to measurable group-level results.

**Examples:**

* Overhauling the resource allocation system for a district.
* Designing a mental health protocol adopted across several workgroups.
* Piloting a conflict resolution system now standard across regions.

---

### üî¢ **Impact Score: 5.0**

**Definition:**
The action was **transformative or foundational**, either creating something essential to daily operations, preventing serious harm, or enabling long-term changes across the network.

**Examples:**

* Developing the water filtration blueprint used by dozens of communities.
* Creating a multi-year public health outreach strategy.
* Solving a major software or infrastructure vulnerability that affected thousands.

Certainly. Here‚Äôs the continuation of the full rubric with the same level of detail, formatting, and clarity‚Äîcovering **Modifier 3: Rarity** and **Modifier 4: Reproducibility**.

---

## üåü **Modifier 3: Rarity**

### **What This Measures**

**Rarity** reflects how **uncommon, specialized, or difficult to access** the contribution was. This includes the uniqueness of the contributor‚Äôs knowledge or skill, the contextual difficulty of providing the contribution, and the infrequency with which such contributions arise. Rarity is not about being elite for its own sake‚Äîit‚Äôs about how unusual the act or ability is within the current time, place, and network of people.

A contribution that anyone could‚Äôve made‚Äîor that gets made often‚Äîscores lower. A contribution that **only a few people were in a position to offer**, or that filled a rare or urgent gap, scores higher. Rarity also includes circumstantial rarity: even if a skill is common, applying it under unusual conditions may raise the score.

---

### üî¢ **Rarity Score: 0.5**

**Definition:**
The contribution was **very common** and could be performed by nearly anyone in the community with minimal notice. It required no specialized background, preparation, or opportunity.

**Examples:**

* Delivering a message or package in a populated area during daylight.
* Sharing a standard community document or set of instructions.
* Offering basic physical help like moving chairs or sweeping a walkway.

---

### üî¢ **Rarity Score: 1.0**

**Definition:**
The task is **commonly needed** and done with some regularity. Many people are capable of doing it, and someone else would likely have done it soon if the contributor hadn‚Äôt stepped in.

**Examples:**

* Hosting a routine meeting or general event.
* Performing a simple maintenance task like replacing a light bulb.
* Writing a weekly summary of group decisions.

---

### üî¢ **Rarity Score: 2.0**

**Definition:**
The contribution was **uncommon or situation-specific**. While not inherently difficult, it required showing up at the right moment, having an uncommon mix of traits, or responding to an unusual need.

**Examples:**

* Translating spoken dialogue during a spontaneous multilingual encounter.
* Troubleshooting a rare error in a custom-built machine.
* Mediating a conflict between groups from different traditions or clusters.

---

### üî¢ **Rarity Score: 3.0**

**Definition:**
This contribution relied on a **specialized background**, an uncommon combination of skills, or experience that is not readily available. If this person hadn‚Äôt done it, the gap might have remained for some time.

**Examples:**

* Repairing a legacy system using outdated knowledge very few people retain.
* Composing and performing a ceremonial song tailored to a specific cultural fusion.
* Designing a blueprint for a new tool based on both modern and ancient techniques.

---

### üî¢ **Rarity Score: 5.0**

**Definition:**
The contribution was **extremely rare**, either because it depended on a truly unique skill set or because the conditions under which it occurred were nearly impossible to replicate. The contributor‚Äôs presence or abilities were not just helpful‚Äîthey were essentially irreplaceable.

**Examples:**

* Using ancient language knowledge to interpret an archaeological find crucial to land claims.
* Single-handedly stopping the spread of fire during a storm using skills gained from both firefighting and off-grid survival.
* Recreating a lost fermentation technique with both cultural and nutritional value, after years of study.

---

## üß¨ **Modifier 4: Reproducibility**

### **What This Measures**

**Reproducibility** refers to how **easily others could recreate** the contribution, either now or in the future. A contribution that is simple to copy, mass-produce, or automate scores lower. One that involves **creativity, judgment, or non-obvious execution** scores higher. The more a task depends on a unique situation, timing, or the individual‚Äôs intuition or trust relationships, the harder it is to reproduce.

Reproducibility is **inversely proportional** to credit: **the less reproducible**, the **more credit** is warranted. Contributions that feel ‚Äúonce in a lifetime‚Äù or ‚Äúonly they could have done this in that moment‚Äù are considered especially valuable under this modifier.

---

### üî¢ **Reproducibility Score: 0.5**

**Definition:**
The action can be **easily repeated** by anyone with access to basic materials or instructions. No special timing, insight, or context was needed. It could be automated or delegated with little loss of value.

**Examples:**

* Copy-pasting a document into a different format.
* Delivering pre-packed goods using a known route.
* Following an existing checklist to change a filter.

---

### üî¢ **Reproducibility Score: 1.0**

**Definition:**
The action is **repeatable with care**, and others could do it if asked. It might require competence or familiarity but involves no special intuition or authority.

**Examples:**

* Facilitating a meeting with a known format.
* Replacing a part using published repair instructions.
* Teaching a lesson from a public curriculum.

---

### üî¢ **Reproducibility Score: 2.0**

**Definition:**
While others could technically reproduce this contribution, it **requires attention to context**, some decision-making, and possibly minor adaptation. The outcome depends in part on the contributor‚Äôs execution.

**Examples:**

* Writing a field report that includes both data and interpretation.
* Providing one-on-one support that builds trust with a vulnerable individual.
* Drafting a proposal after listening to many conflicting perspectives.

---

### üî¢ **Reproducibility Score: 3.0**

**Definition:**
This task would be **difficult for others to replicate** with the same effect. It involves timing, trust, or original design work. A different person trying the same thing would likely get different results‚Äîor none at all.

**Examples:**

* Calming a panicked crowd due to a unique tone and presence.
* Designing a tool for a need no one else had clearly articulated.
* Mediating a dispute because both sides personally respected the mediator.

---

### üî¢ **Reproducibility Score: 5.0**

**Definition:**
This contribution was **fundamentally non-reproducible**. Only this individual could have done it in the way it was done‚Äîdue to their story, their standing, their timing, or their synthesis of skills. No substitute was realistically possible.

**Examples:**

* Making a confession of wrongdoing that defused long-standing inter-group tension.
* Giving a performance or testimony that changed the trajectory of a movement.
* Spotting and solving a systemic design flaw that had eluded experts for years, using an intuitive approach no one else had applied.
