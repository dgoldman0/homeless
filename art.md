What is art? This question has been asked and studied again and again. Here's my take.

> Art is the process of communicating what is in our internal synesthetic language of thought, to others, while attempting to preserve its form, whereas typical communication is a translation from internal language of thought into our shared communication language, which is not intentionally form preserving.
