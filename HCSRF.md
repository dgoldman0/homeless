**Title:** A Coherent Framework for Evaluating Statehood and Responsibility: A Hybrid Coherent Statehood & Responsibility Framework (HCSRF)

**Introduction**

International law offers competing paradigms for evaluating statehood and assigning responsibility for the actions of governing authorities, but both the traditional models—declarative and constitutive—leave important gaps when applied to fragmented, post-colonial, or internally contested polities.

The **declarative model**, most clearly defined in the 1933 Montevideo Convention, holds that statehood depends on four objective criteria: a permanent population, defined territory, government, and capacity to enter into relations with other states. While this model has the advantage of neutrality, it is often underdetermined in practice. For example, the criterion of "government" raises difficult questions: Must a state exercise uniform, effective governance across its whole territory? Can a state persist if part of its territory is under foreign occupation or controlled by an insurgent group? The declarative model also struggles to address the ambiguities of transitional governance or contested sovereignties that arise during civil war, secession, or decolonization.

The **constitutive model**, by contrast, asserts that a state exists only if it is recognized as such by other states. This approach anchors statehood in the subjective acts of recognition, lending flexibility but also inviting inconsistency, political gamesmanship, and selectivity. It fails to explain why some recognized entities lack essential governance, or why others with full administrative systems are denied legal statehood. Recognition itself becomes a political currency, creating a mismatch between functionality and status.

Each model alone is too rigid or too arbitrary. The declarative model provides insufficient guidance in contested governance scenarios, while the constitutive model offers no principled threshold for when recognition should be granted or withheld. Moreover, neither model accounts for overlapping jurisdictions, dual authority claims, or partial international participation—features common to modern quasi-states and divided societies.

To reconcile and clarify these tensions, this essay introduces and applies a **Hybrid Coherent Statehood & Responsibility Framework (HCSRF)**. This framework draws from both traditions while adding structured internal criteria and emphasizing **functional external agency**. It defines statehood through a modular, layered approach that includes people, territory, bifurcated authority (legal mandate and effective governance), and an external agency threshold. It also builds in tools for assigning responsibility (attribution vs. due diligence) and includes mechanisms for evaluating legitimacy, directionality of political ruptures, and border claims.

By explicitly addressing fragmented authority, disputed recognition, and asymmetric control, HCSRF provides a clearer, more consistent framework for analyzing statehood in contemporary international law.

**I. Defining the HCSRF Framework**

HCSRF rests on four pillars and two responsibility tracks, offering a modular and extensible system for analyzing complex cases.

**Pillars of Statehood:**

1. **People**: A state must contain a stable, resident community that can sustain governance and form a shared political identity. Transience or extreme diaspora without territorial cohesion weakens this pillar.
2. **Territory**: The state must lay claim to a geographically defined area. While disputes or partial occupation do not negate statehood, the claimed area must be sufficiently bounded to allow legal and administrative function.
3. **Authority (Dual Test)**:

   * **Legal Mandate (LM)**: The entity must possess a recognized legal foundation for governance, such as a constitution, treaty, or continuity from a legitimate predecessor. It answers: who *should* govern?
   * **Effective Governance (EG)**: The ability to implement law, maintain security, collect taxes, and provide basic services in practice. It answers: who *does* govern?
4. **External Agency (EA)**: The capacity to engage in relations with other states and international organizations. EA is satisfied through a combination of:

   * Formal recognition by ≥15 UN member states; or
   * Membership in at least one intergovernmental organization that only admits states (e.g., UN, WTO, IMF).

**Responsibility Tracks:**

* **Attribution Track (AT)**: Actions of LM organs, or of EG actors exercising or usurping LM authority, are legally imputed to the state. This includes agents operating with state authorization or under color of state authority.
* **Due-Diligence Track (DDT)**: When LM and EG reside in different actors, the LM-holder is obligated to use all feasible means to prevent internationally wrongful acts by EG-holders within the shared territorial claim.

**Bridging Rule for Split-Control Territories:**
A polity remains a single state if LM + EA reside in one actor and the EG-holder lacks independent EA. Only if both parties independently meet all four pillars does the framework classify them as separate states. This rule prioritizes international coherence and prevents premature fission of statehood.

**II. Definitions for Clarity and Consistency**

| Term                                    | Definition                                                                                                                                                            |
| --------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Legal Mandate (LM)                      | The formal right to govern, grounded in law or recognition.                                                                                                           |
| Effective Governance (EG)               | Practical, sustained control over state functions.                                                                                                                    |
| External Agency (EA)                    | The ability to bind the polity internationally through recognized acts.                                                                                               |
| Jurisdictional Capacity (JC)            | Legal authority to govern, even if obstructed in practice.                                                                                                            |
| Attribution Track (AT)                  | Assigns legal responsibility for acts to the state.                                                                                                                   |
| Due Diligence (DD)                      | The obligation to act reasonably to prevent wrongful acts.                                                                                                            |
| Split-Control Territory (SCT)           | A state where LM and EG reside in different hands.                                                                                                                    |
| Directionality & Legitimacy Layer (DLL) | An adjustment layer under the Authority pillar assessing which party maintained constitutional continuity, legality, popular consent, and responsibility for rupture. |

**III. Directionality & Legitimacy Layer (DLL)**

This layer refines the Authority pillar by distinguishing between lawful continuity and breakaway governance. It adjusts LM strength and due-diligence burdens based on a structured evaluation:

**DLL Components (each scored 0–3):**

1. **Constitutional Continuity (CC)**: Whether the actor adhered to the preexisting legal and constitutional order.
2. **Procedural Legality (PL)**: Whether lawful succession processes (e.g., elections, appointments) were followed.
3. **Popular Endorsement (PE)**: Whether the actor enjoys demonstrable and broad-based support from the population.
4. **Rupture Fault Allocation (RFA)**: Which actor initiated the political rupture through unlawful or violent means.

**DLL Uses:**

* **LM Weighting**: LM score = base LM × (1 + DLL/12), emphasizing stronger legitimacy.
* **DD Burden Adjustment**: Due-diligence burden increases with RFA, especially if the LM-holder contributed to the split.
* **EG Labeling**: EG actors with DLL < 4 are considered insurgent; DLL ≥ 7 may qualify as proto-governments in the Authority analysis.

**IV. Border Legitimacy & Constraint Framework (BLCF)**

To evaluate the legitimacy of territorial claims, the BLCF introduces five constraints, each scored 0–3:

1. **Source of Title (STC)**: Legal basis, such as treaties, arbitral awards, or colonial lines at independence.
2. **Prohibition on Force (PFC)**: Whether territory was acquired in violation of the UN Charter’s ban on aggressive war.
3. **Self-Determination (SDC)**: Degree to which local populations consented to the claimed boundary.
4. **Effectivity & Administration (EAC)**: Evidence of long-standing, peaceful, and functional administration.
5. **International Affirmation (IAC)**: Number and quality of recognitions or affirmations from states and IGOs.

**Scoring Interpretation:**

* **12–15**: Valid Core Border
* **8–11**: Negotiable / Gray Zone
* **≤7**: Invalid Claim

States claiming gray zones incur enhanced due-diligence duties. Invalid claims require negotiation or third-party resolution.

**V. Due Diligence Rule (DD-4)**

Due diligence assesses whether an LM-holder has met its obligation to prevent harm by an EG actor through the following four metrics:

1. **Foreseeability (F)**: Did the LM-holder have actual or constructive knowledge of the risk?
2. **Capacity (C)**: What legal, coercive, or diplomatic means were genuinely available to the LM-holder?
3. **Measures (M)**: What concrete steps were taken, grouped into the LECS bands: Legislate, Enforce, Cooperate, Signal.
4. **Effectiveness (E)**: Were the chosen measures reasonable in light of capacity, even if not ultimately successful?

Each component is scored 0–3. A total of 8/12 or higher is deemed substantial compliance. A breach occurs when the LM-holder omits or grossly underperforms relative to its known capacity and the foreseeability of harm.

**Conclusion**

The Hybrid Coherent Statehood & Responsibility Framework (HCSRF) offers a principled and analytically rigorous alternative to the traditional dichotomy between the Montevideo (declarative) and constitutive theories of statehood. By explicitly disaggregating the authority pillar into legal mandate and effective governance, and by layering in both internal legitimacy and external agency requirements, the framework accounts for the realities of contested sovereignty, dual governments, and asymmetric control—conditions increasingly common in the 21st-century geopolitical landscape.

The addition of the Directionality & Legitimacy Layer (DLL) enhances the framework’s ability to distinguish between rightful and usurping authorities within a shared national project, calibrating both the weight of a government's legal mandate and the scale of its due-diligence obligations. Similarly, the Border Legitimacy & Constraint Framework (BLCF) reintroduces historically grounded constraints on border claims, countering the erosion of territorial legitimacy in the face of strategic ambiguity, selective recognition, or force-based revisionism.

Perhaps most importantly, HCSRF creates an integrated responsibility architecture: it avoids falsely attributing the acts of rogue de facto regimes to legitimate authorities while still insisting that recognized governments meet a defined burden of due diligence in preventing or disavowing those acts. This two-track approach ensures that international accountability is not rendered toothless by incapacity nor unfairly imposed despite material severance of control.

While no model can fully depoliticize the recognition of states or the imputation of responsibility, HCSRF provides a defensible scaffolding by which states, scholars, and international institutions can evaluate claims of statehood and obligations of conduct with greater internal coherence, cross-case consistency, and principled reasoning. In doing so, it contributes meaningfully to both the theoretical architecture and the practical adjudication of international legal identity and moral responsibility.
