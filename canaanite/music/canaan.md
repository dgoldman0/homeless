# Step One: Draft skeleton poem of Canaan based on Canaan.Asia document -> Non-linear abstract format.

## **I. The Soil Breathes Without Asking**

Beneath sandal and siege,
beneath empire and exile,
the soil stirs—a patient womb,
never forgetting the names it once whispered.

Jericho exhales dust,
olive trees cradle the memory of hands
that harvested without flag or border.
The grape ripens in the same sunlight
that once gilded the altars of El.

Every stone is fluent
in the language of feet returning.

## **II. Thread of Flame**

From reed to rock, from reed to clay,
the voice first arrived as a shape:
a hook, a house, a doorway.
Proto-letters dreamt of firelight and prophecy,
tongues tied to thunder
and wine jars.

The Baal Cycle sings still
in the trembling of parchment,
in Samaritan chants and Palestinian embroidery,
in Hebrew dreams,
in Aramaic prayers
that the wind carries between minarets and ruins.

Language is a rope we climb
into the dark of what we forgot.

## **III. Salt and Smoke**

The sea has no memory for nations—
only for sails.

Tyre's teeth chewed purple into silk,
and Sidon's lips kissed cedar into ship bones.
Phoenician wind became alphabet,
drifting into Greek temples,
nesting in Latin shadows.

Trade was the heart's own myth:
a pulse of bronze, myrrh, tin,
and ideas whispered in harbor smoke
while fish scales blinked like stars
in foreign tongues.

## **IV. Grove of Names**

In the hill's hush,
the gods gathered—
not as statues but as seasons.

El with his silver beard of sky.
Asherah dancing with doves in groves of breath.
Baal, thunder-bringer,
his voice the sudden bloom of rain.
Anat, blood-slick and laughing,
carving justice with a blade of wheat.

These were not gods to be obeyed—
but to be mirrored, feared, and made love to.

Now, only the tree remains.
Still rooted. Still reaching.
An altar where children draw names in the dust
without knowing why.

---

## **V. The Many-Faced People**

The face changes—
but the eyes remain.

A Jew in Jerusalem lights a lamp
his ancestor lit in Sidon.
A Samaritan bleeds a lamb
on the same hill where Baal once danced.
A Palestinian sows barley
in patterns pressed by Canaanite heels.

The mask shifts: Hebrew, Arab, Aramaic,
but the face beneath breathes the same air,
mourns the same hills,
writes the same longing
into the song of olive branches.

Identity is a cloak sewn from old prayers
and sudden betrayals.
But the hands that stitch it
always know the thread.

---

## **VI. House of Clay and Fire**

Pottery remembers what humans forget.

The bowl's curve is the curve of a child's cheek.
The hearth knows the rhythm of absence,
how a mother hums as she grinds grain
with a stone older than history.

Walls rise and fall. Cities burn.
But the soot on the ceiling tells stories
no empire can rewrite.

Embroidery. Dance. Bread broken at dusk.
The sacred lives in repetition.

---

## **VII. The Dust Speaks in Silence**

Ash writes no scripture,
but it buries none.

Even silence is a kind of archive.
A place name echoing in another tongue.
A ritual danced by those
who forgot its name but not its meaning.

Colonies came, and temples fell.
Languages dressed themselves in new skins.
But beneath every mosque, every church,
every state and census,
Canaan sleeps with one eye open.

---

## **VIII. The Root Remembers**

The archaeologist uncovers a shard
and hears a lullaby.

A boy draws a tree with seven arms
and calls it his flag.
A grandmother seasons lentils
the way her mother's mother's mother did.

We are not lost.
We are rearranged.

Canaan is not a past—
it is a rhythm,
a cadence still singing
through the blood of stone
and the breath of soil.
