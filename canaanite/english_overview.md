# Modern Canaanite: A Constructed Inclusive Levantine Language

## Overview

**Modern Canaanite** is a constructed language initiative that reimagines Hebrew — the only currently spoken Canaanite language — as an inclusive, neutral, and modern vehicle for expression across the Levant. It seeks to build a new linguistic identity rooted in Semitic heritage while addressing modern concerns of gender inclusivity and global accessibility.

This project draws inspiration from two sources:

1. **Hebrew**, as the base grammar, lexicon, and cultural foundation.
2. **Klingon transliteration**, as the alternative script, due to its compatibility with Semitic phonetics and its use of a Latin-based, phonemic writing system.

## Key Goals

* **Gender Neutrality:** Move beyond the binary masculine/feminine system of Hebrew.
* **Phonetic Regularity:** Use a Latin-based script (modeled on Klingon romanization) to maintain one-to-one sound-letter correspondences.
* **Accessibility:** Allow speakers and learners without access to Hebrew script to engage with a Semitic language.
* **Cultural Continuity and Reclamation:** Retain core Semitic features while emphasizing inclusivity and pan-Canaanite identity.

## Core Linguistic Features

Modern Canaanite restructures Hebrew grammar to enable **gender neutrality** and **morphological clarity** while honoring the **root-based, nonconcatenative structure** of Semitic languages. This approach avoids artificial suffixes and instead leverages **internal vocalic patterns** and **templatic morphology** to mark neutral forms.

---

### 1. **Gender Neutralization via Root-Pattern Morphology**

Rather than adding external suffixes like *‑n* or *‑an*, Modern Canaanite introduces **dedicated gender-neutral patterns** (paradigms) for each part of speech, mirroring Hebrew’s own internal flexibility.

#### A. Pronouns

Pronouns are simplified and neutralized. Gender distinctions are removed, and plurality is regularized.

| Role          | Hebrew (Masc./Fem.)     | Modern Canaanite |
| ------------- | ----------------------- | ---------------- |
| 1st person sg | אני (ani)               | **ani**          |
| 2nd person sg | אתה / את (ata / at)     | **iya**          |
| 3rd person sg | הוא / היא (hu / hi)     | **iya**          |
| 1st person pl | אנחנו (anachnu)         | **anakhnu**      |
| 2nd person pl | אתם / אתן (atem / aten) | **im**           |
| 3rd person pl | הם / הן (hem / hen)     | **im**           |

*Note: Singular/plural distinctions are retained, but **gender is collapsed into a unified form.***

---

#### B. Verbs: Neutral Binyanim (Verb Templates)

Modern Hebrew marks gender through conjugation (e.g., *halakh* vs. *halkha*), but verbs are derived from roots inserted into **binyanim** (verb templates). Modern Canaanite proposes a **neutral binyan**, which applies consistent vowel and pattern choices to form gender-inclusive verbs.

**Neutral Binyan Example:**

| Root | Masculine Hebrew     | Feminine Hebrew       | **Modern Canaanite** (Neutral)     |
| ---- | -------------------- | --------------------- | ---------------------------------- |
| הל״ך | *halakh* (he walked) | *halkha* (she walked) | **hilakh** (they walked – neutral) |
| אמר  | *amar* (he said)     | *amra* (she said)     | **imer** (they said – neutral)     |
| עבד  | *avad* (he worked)   | *avda* (she worked)   | **ivid** (they worked – neutral)   |

*This neutral binyan — tentatively called **Binyan HaShava** ("equalizing pattern") — uses vowel forms like **i-a**, **i-e**, or **i-i**, depending on root consonant compatibility.*

---

#### C. Nouns: Gender-Neutral Mishkalim (Noun Patterns)

Rather than appending suffixes like *‑n*, Modern Canaanite creates neutral versions of common noun patterns by adjusting internal vowels or drawing from existing unmarked forms.

**Examples:**

| Hebrew Gendered | Meaning       | **Modern Canaanite** | Method                          |
| --------------- | ------------- | -------------------- | ------------------------------- |
| תלמיד / תלמידה  | Student       | **telmid**           | New neutral pattern (CeCCiC)    |
| שחקן / שחקנית   | Actor/Actress | **sakhin**           | Triconsonantal root in CiCCiC   |
| מורה / מורה     | Teacher       | **moray**            | Based on unmarked form + stress |
| עובד / עובדת    | Worker        | **ʿivid**            | Pattern aligned with verb root  |

*Where existing forms are already neutral (e.g., *moreh/morah*, *rofeh/rofah*), context-based neutrality is favored or a regularized vowel form is proposed.*

---

#### D. Adjectives and Participles

Adjectives often align with verb participles in Hebrew. Modern Canaanite extends the **neutral binyan** logic here:

| Root | Masculine | Feminine   | **Neutral** |
| ---- | --------- | ---------- | ----------- |
| חייב | *khayav*  | *khayevet* | **khayiv**  |
| בטוח | *batuach* | *btuḥa*    | **bitiḥ**   |
| פתוח | *patuach* | *ptucha*   | **pituḥ**   |

*This makes adjectives consistent with verbal morphology, reducing redundancy.*

---

### 2. **Flexible Syntax with Clarified Agreement**

Modern Canaanite accepts both **SVO** and **VSO** structures (like Hebrew and Arabic), but relaxes strict agreement rules that rely on gendered noun-verb matching. Instead, agreement is based on:

* **Number** (singular/plural)
* **Person** (1st/2nd/3rd)
* **Clarity in context**, rather than rigid inflection

**Example:**

> *iya hilakh el hamisrad le’haqin et hamatsag.*
> “They \[neutral] went to the office to prepare the presentation.”

---

### 3. **Possession and Reference**

To avoid gendered possessive suffixes (e.g., *‑o*, *‑a*), Modern Canaanite uses:

* **Unified suffix `‑in`** for “their/his/her” (context-resolved)
* Optional **particles** (like *shel*) in speech to clarify when needed

**Examples:**

* *seferin* – their/his/her book
* *ha'beit shel iya* – the house of them (neutral)

---

### 4. **Inclusivity Beyond the Binary**

This system isn’t just for neutrality — it creates space for **nonbinary identities**, **ambiguous cases**, and **institutional/collective references**. By using **morphological symmetry** instead of artificial additions, it supports:

* **Natural-sounding speech**
* **Ease of acquisition** for those familiar with Semitic structure
* **Cultural continuity** with Hebrew, Arabic, and Aramaic roots

---

## Writing System: Klingon-Style Romanization

### Why Klingon Romanization?

* Designed for phonemic clarity
* Compatible with Semitic consonantal roots
* Uses **Latin letters**, which descend from ancient Semitic abjads
* Distinct glyphs (e.g., `H`, `Q`, `S`) already fit Semitic phonemes

## Sample Translation Process

---

Let's begin by selecting a sentence in Standard Hebrew that contains gendered elements and would benefit from neutralization.

### 🔹 Selected Hebrew Sentence

**המזכירה קראה לעובדים כדי להכין את המסמכים לפגישה, והם הגיעו בזמן.**  
*“The secretary (fem.) called the workers (masc.) to prepare the documents for the meeting, and they (masc.) arrived on time.”*

This sentence is gendered in multiple ways:

- **המזכירה** – explicitly feminine noun.
- **עובדים** – masculine plural noun.
- **הם** – masculine plural pronoun.
- **הגיעה** – feminine verb conjugation.
- **הכין** – masculine verb.

We will now proceed step-by-step to transform this into an inclusive Modern Canaanite sentence.

---

### 🔸 Step 1: Neutralize Subject Nouns

Replace **המזכירה** (hamazkira) with a **neutral form** derived from the same root — ז-כ-ר ("to remember/record") — in a neutralized noun pattern. A proposed pattern is **CeCCiC**, resulting in **mazkir → mezkir** or **mazkira → mizker**. We’ll choose **mizker** for clarity and neutrality.

**עובדים** (ʿovdim, masc. pl.) becomes **ʿividan**, following the **i‑i** neutral verbal noun pattern extended with plural marker **‑an**.

| Original     | Neutral Form  | Notes                                 |
|--------------|---------------|---------------------------------------|
| המזכירה      | **hamizker**  | Root ז-כ-ר in neutral CeCCeR form     |
| עובדים       | **ʿividan**   | Verb root ע-ב-ד, nounized with **‑an** |

---

### 🔸 Step 2: Replace Binary Pronouns

**הם** (hem, masc. pl.) is replaced with **im**, the **gender-neutral plural third-person pronoun**.

| Original | Neutral |
|----------|---------|
| הם       | **im**  |

---

### 🔸 Step 3: Neutralize Verbs

Now, conjugate the verbs **קראה**, **להכין**, and **הגיעו** using the **neutral binyan** (Binyan HaShava). Each root must be retemplated into its **gender-neutral i‑a / i‑e / i‑i** form, then pluralized with **‑an** if needed.

#### Verb: *קראה* (“she called”)
- Root: ק‑ר‑א
- Masculine: *kara*
- Feminine: *kar’a*
- Neutral: **kira** (singular neutral)
- In this context, since the subject is singular (hamizker), we use **kira**

#### Verb: *להכין* (“to prepare”)
- Root: כ‑ו‑נ
- Infinitive remains **lehakhin** — infinitives in Hebrew are already somewhat neutral; no change needed.

#### Verb: *הגיעו* (“they arrived”)
- Root: נ‑ג‑ע (or ה‑ג‑ע in Hif'il binyan)
- Masculine: *higiʿu*
- Feminine: *higiʿu*
- Neutral: **higiʿan** — plural neutral with suffix **‑an**

| Original     | Neutral     | Explanation                          |
|--------------|-------------|--------------------------------------|
| קראה         | **kira**    | Singular, neutral subject            |
| להכין        | **lehakhin**| Already neutral infinitive           |
| הגיעו        | **higiʿan** | Pluralized neutral verb              |

---

### 🔸 Step 4: Check Agreement and Particles

Ensure that:
- Particles like **כדי**, **את**, **ל־**, **וה־**, **ב־** remain intact.
- Agreement in number is preserved (e.g., plural **higiʿan** agrees with plural pronoun **im** and noun **ʿividan**).

---

### 🔸 Step 5: Assemble the Inclusive Modern Canaanite Sentence

**hamizker kira la‑ʿividan kedei lehakhin et hamismakhim la‑pgiSha, ve‑im higiʿan ba‑zman.**

---

### 6 . Inclusive Sentence – Classical Transliteration

**hamizker kira la‑ʿividan kedei lehakhin et hamismakhim la‑pgiSha, ve‑im higiʿan ba‑zman.**

*“The secretary [neutral] called the workers [neutral plural] to prepare the documents for the meeting, and they [neutral plural] arrived on time.”*

---

### 7 . Converting to the Klingon‑Style Romanisation

We now transliterate **directly from the inclusive Hebrew sentence** into **Klingon-style romanisation**, based strictly on the phoneme mapping from the original Hebrew letters — not from classical or scholarly transliteration.

| מ             | m             | **m**          | מסמכים → *mismakhim*            |
| נ             | n             | **n**          | בזמן → *bazman*                 |

| ק             | q             | **q**          | המזקר → *hamizqer*              |
| ר             | r             | **r**          | קירא → *kira*                    |
| ס             | s             | **s**          | מסמכים → *mismakhim*            |
| שׁ            | sh            | **S**          | פגישה → *pgiSa*                 |
| ת             | t             | **t**          | את → *et*                        |

---

#### Final Klingon‑Style Transliteration:

**hamizqer kira la'ividan kedei lehakhin et hamismakhim lapgiSa, veim higi'an bazman.**

---

This sentence now:
- Uses **gender-neutral pronouns and nouns**
- Applies **templatic internal vowel changes** for neutrality
- Follows **consistent morphological patterns**
- Preserves **phonological authenticity** via Klingon-style Latinization
