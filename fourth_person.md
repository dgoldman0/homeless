### Fourth-Person Narration: The Composite Voice in Interpreter-Mediated Storytelling

When storytelling relies fundamentally on interpretation, the narrator is neither the original storyteller nor the interpreter alone, but rather a convolution—a transformed voice emerging uniquely from their interaction. I propose that this narrative phenomenon is best understood through the concept of **fourth-person narration**, distinct from traditional grammatical categories.

### Understanding Traditional Narration and Its Limitations

Traditional narratology typically recognizes three distinct "persons":

* **First-person** narration (*I*): Direct self-reference by the narrator.
* **Second-person** narration (*you*): Direct address to the reader or listener.
* **Third-person** narration (*he/she/they*): Reference to others external to the narrator or listener ([Kindlepreneur, 2024](https://kindlepreneur.com/point-of-view-examples/)).

However, this framework inadequately describes scenarios involving real-time interpreter mediation. In interpreter-dependent communication—such as a Deaf signer (Party A) conveying a narrative through a hearing interpreter (Party B) to an audience (Party C)—the voice that emerges is neither singular nor dual but rather composite.

### Interpreter-Mediated Storytelling as a Convolution

In interpreter-mediated storytelling:

* **Party A (the original narrator)** supplies the core narrative intention and storyworld framework.
* **Party B (the interpreter)** actively and necessarily shapes how Party A’s intention is linguistically, culturally, and contextually transmitted to Party C.

This process closely resembles the mathematical concept of a convolution, where two distinct functions combine irreversibly into a new, distinct function ([Weisstein, 2024](https://mathworld.wolfram.com/Convolution.html)). The resulting narrative voice (what Party C perceives) is thus neither Party A nor Party B alone, but a transformative combination of both.

### Why Existing Models Fall Short

Existing translation and interpreting models such as Theo Hermans' "translator’s voice" ([Hermans, 1996](https://doi.org/10.1075/target.8.1.04her)) or the "implied translator" concept ([O’Sullivan, 2003](https://doi.org/10.7202/006966ar)) typically frame the interpreter as adding a separate voice or textual layer. However, these models inadequately capture the interpretative simultaneity and emergent nature of real-time interpreter-mediated narratives.

Erving Goffman's participation framework offers closer relevance by dividing speaker roles into **principal** (originator of intent), **author** (creator of wording), and **animator** (performer of speech) ([Goffman, 1981](https://doi.org/10.2307/41407729)). Yet even this framework doesn't fully reflect the irreducibly composite nature of the narration resulting from interpreter mediation.

### Defining Fourth-Person Narration

To better describe this emergent phenomenon, we propose **fourth-person narration** as:

> Fourth-person narration refers to a narrative voice that only materializes through the necessary interaction between multiple agents, such that none of the agents constitute the narrator alone, and yet there is only one narrative voice. 

### Situating Fourth-Person Narration in Current Scholarship

This idea aligns closely with contemporary theories on "distributed agency," which already recognize that narrative authorship can be diffused across multiple interacting agents ([Tenen, 2018](https://doi.org/10.1080/13825577.2018.1425919)). Likewise, Shay’s "composite voice" concept in interpreting studies acknowledges a similar phenomenon—though not yet explicitly positioned within narratological terminology ([Mole, 2018](https://doi.org/10.1080/0907676X.2018.1454824)).

Introducing the term **fourth-person narration** thus provides a robust theoretical grounding for understanding interpreter-mediated storytelling, filling a conceptual gap by explicitly naming and theorizing an already observable phenomenon.

### Practical Implications and Future Directions

Recognizing interpreter-mediated narratives as fourth-person narration highlights the interpreter’s significant, yet traditionally undervalued, contribution. This understanding could lead to increased transparency about interpreter influences, improved interpreter training emphasizing narrative agency, and better methodologies in discourse analysis and interpretation studies. 

### Conclusion

Fourth-person narration clearly encapsulates the complex interaction inherent in interpreter-mediated storytelling, moving beyond traditional narrative frameworks to accurately represent an emergent, composite voice. Its recognition can substantially enrich theoretical models and practical approaches in translation, interpretation, and narrative studies, acknowledging the nuanced reality of narrative agency as inherently collaborative and transformative.

### Draft Note

Initial version was created with a very quick and dirty search and sources may not be valid, and certain theories, etc. may be incorrect. Consider this a work in progress. I'll note when it feels more complete, if I get that far.
