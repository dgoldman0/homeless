### Fourth-Person Narration: The Composite Voice in Interpreter-Mediated Storytelling

When storytelling relies fundamentally on interpretation, the narrator is neither the original storyteller nor the interpreter alone, but rather a convolution—a transformed voice emerging uniquely from their interaction. I propose that this narrative phenomenon is best understood through the concept of **fourth-person narration**, distinct from traditional grammatical categories.

### Understanding Traditional Narration and Its Limitations

Traditional narratology typically recognizes three distinct "persons":

* **First-person** narration (*I*): Direct self-reference by the narrator.
* **Second-person** narration (*you*): Direct address to the reader or listener.
* **Third-person** narration (*he/she/they*): Reference to others external to the narrator or listener ([Kindlepreneur, 2024](https://kindlepreneur.com/point-of-view-examples/)).

However, this framework inadequately describes scenarios involving real-time interpreter mediation. In interpreter-dependent communication—such as a Deaf signer (Party A) conveying a narrative through a hearing interpreter (Party B) to an audience (Party C)—the voice that emerges is neither singular nor dual but rather composite.

### Interpreter-Mediated Storytelling as a Convolution

In interpreter-mediated storytelling:

* **Party A (the original narrator)** supplies the core narrative intention and storyworld framework.
* **Party B (the interpreter)** actively and necessarily shapes how Party A’s intention is linguistically, culturally, and contextually transmitted to Party C.

This process closely resembles the mathematical concept of a convolution, where two distinct functions combine irreversibly into a new, distinct function ([Weisstein, 2024](https://mathworld.wolfram.com/Convolution.html)). The resulting narrative voice (what Party C perceives) is thus neither Party A nor Party B alone, but a transformative combination of both.

### Why Existing Models Fall Short

Existing translation and interpreting models such as Theo Hermans' "translator’s voice" ([Hermans, 1996](https://doi.org/10.1075/target.8.1.04her)) or the "implied translator" concept ([O’Sullivan, 2003](https://doi.org/10.7202/006966ar)) typically frame the interpreter as adding a separate voice or textual layer. However, these models inadequately capture the interpretative simultaneity and emergent nature of real-time interpreter-mediated narratives.

Erving Goffman's participation framework offers closer relevance by dividing speaker roles into **principal** (originator of intent), **author** (creator of wording), and **animator** (performer of speech) ([Goffman, 1981](https://doi.org/10.2307/41407729)). Yet even this framework doesn't fully reflect the irreducibly composite nature of the narration resulting from interpreter mediation.

### Defining Fourth-Person Narration

To better describe this emergent phenomenon, we propose **fourth-person narration** as:

> A narrative mode that emerges from the necessary interaction of multiple agents, where none singularly embodies the narrator, yet together they produce a unified narrative voice.

### Situating Fourth-Person Narration in Current Scholarship

This idea aligns closely with contemporary theories on "distributed agency," which already recognize that narrative authorship can be diffused across multiple interacting agents ([Tenen, 2018](https://doi.org/10.1080/13825577.2018.1425919)). Likewise, Shay’s "composite voice" concept in interpreting studies acknowledges a similar phenomenon—though not yet explicitly positioned within narratological terminology ([Mole, 2018](https://doi.org/10.1080/0907676X.2018.1454824)).

Introducing the term **fourth-person narration** thus provides a robust theoretical grounding for understanding interpreter-mediated storytelling, filling a conceptual gap by explicitly naming and theorizing an already observable phenomenon.

### More General Contexts: The Emergence of Fourth-Person Narration in Everyday Storytelling

The dynamic of narrative emergence found in interpreter-dependent environments also appears frequently in everyday life. For example, a parent often acts as an intermediary between another adult—such as a doctor, teacher, or caregiver—and a child. In such interactions, the parent reshapes adult discourse into language and tone that match the child’s comprehension and emotional needs. The parent selects vocabulary, adjusts emphasis, and shifts delivery to suit the listener, while still drawing content from the original speaker. In this situation, the narrative voice perceived by the child grows from both the adult’s intention and the parent’s transformation. The narrator, therefore, exists through their combined action—a unified voice formed through relational construction.

Live storytelling offers another space where this blended narration becomes especially clear. When a parent reads aloud from a book, the written text contains an implicit narrator with a specific voice, tone, and structure. Yet the reading parent brings expressive choices: dramatic pacing, emotional shading, vocal characterizations, and sound effects. These elements reshape the narrative experience. The storyteller enlivens the written voice, expanding its impact and inflecting it with presence and style. The result becomes a single narrative expression, forged through the interplay of text and performer. Each represents a distinct convolution, reshaping and fusing that original voice with the storyteller’s expressive identity.

This collaborative shaping explains why some storytellers deeply engage their listeners, even when sharing the same source material. Each performer contributes unique rhythms, interpretations, and emotional cues, creating distinct storytelling experiences. For instance, one parent might emphasize calmness and reassurance, while another draws out suspense, humor, or excitement. Each version relies on the same written text, yet each voice carries a personal imprint that becomes part of the narration itself.

In all of these settings, narration functions as a relational process. The storyteller and the originating content both contribute essential layers, each enhancing the whole without fully defining it alone. The narrative voice heard by the listener emerges from this cooperation. Fourth-person narration describes this synthesis: a storytelling voice shaped through multiple agents acting together, forming a unified channel through which the story reaches the audience. This voice expresses a single narrative presence while carrying the depth and complexity of its plural origins.
### Practical Implications and Future Directions

Recognizing interpreter-mediated narratives as fourth-person narration highlights the interpreter’s significant, yet traditionally undervalued, contribution. This understanding could lead to increased transparency about interpreter influences, improved interpreter training emphasizing narrative agency, and better methodologies in discourse analysis and interpretation studies. 

### Conclusion

Fourth-person narration clearly encapsulates the complex interaction inherent in interpreter-mediated storytelling, moving beyond traditional narrative frameworks to accurately represent an emergent, composite voice. Its recognition can substantially enrich theoretical models and practical approaches in translation, interpretation, and narrative studies, acknowledging the nuanced reality of narrative agency as inherently collaborative and transformative.

### Draft Note

Initial version was created with a very quick and dirty search and sources may not be valid, and certain theories, etc. may be incorrect. Consider this a work in progress. I'll note when it feels more complete, if I get that far. Do not trust citations. And they will be corrected. General definition seems on point though.
